<p1>
    The <i>ENIAC</i> computer was one of the first computers out there.
    The <i>ENIAC</i> computer was first built in World War II by the united states. 
    It was designed to calculate artillery firing tables to help troops on the field to navigate better and hit their targets with precise aim. 
    <i>ENIAC</i> was first thought of by John Mauchly 1942, but later was stolen by John Vincent Atanasoff who then won a lawsuit declaring it his. 
    It was the first computer to have any sort of purpose to it, during a cycle it could write or read from a register or add and subtract two numbers.
