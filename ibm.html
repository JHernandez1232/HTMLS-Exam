<h2 id="IBM">IBM's Personal Computer</h2>

<p>
    on August 12, 1981, the <i>IBM Personal computer</i> would be introduced to the public as one of the most key milestones (in my opinion) in the development of a computer, logical device or software. 
    A group of containing 12 strategists were picked, working around the clock to come up with a plan for hardware, software, manufacturing setup and how to sale the product. 
    The development team went outside of the traditional boundaries of product development within IMB, the team would go to outside vendors to buy their parts such as a CPU and other products needed to compose the <i>IBM personal computer</i>, doing this, they were able to release the product in 12 months. 
    After the <i>IBM Personal Computer</i>, it became the leading platform in a revolution that would bring other companies to make their own copy of the computer but better and better over the next few years bring us to the present.
    The <i>IBM Personal computer</i> almost didn't become a reality, poeple were very spectacle of the idea asking questions like "why would someone want to bring a computer inside their home?".
    In the 1970s, if you happem to have some left over work you were to bring back home a breifcase full papers, oonce you were home, you would either have a pincle to finish up or a type writer.
    Their weren't any technology that could help yoou at home to finihs up your work, if you didn't have any knowledge of a word you'll have to use a deictionary for assistants, while on the other hand in the present you were just able to pull out yoour laptop or phone and look up a word that yoou couldn't understand of spell.
