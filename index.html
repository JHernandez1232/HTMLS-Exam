<h2 id="ENIAC">ENIAC</h2>

<p1>The ENIAC computer was one of the first computers out there.
    The ENIAC computer was first built in World War II by the united states. 
    It was designed to calculate artillery firing tables to help troops on the field to navigate better and hit their targets with precise aim. 
    ENIAC was first thought of by John Mauchly 1942, but later was stolen by John Vincent Atanasoff who then won a lawsuit declaring it his. 
    It was the first computer to have any sort of purpose to it, during a cycle it could write or read from a register or add and subtract two numbers. 
    The construction of ENIAC Begin in 1943 and was completed in 1946, by 1956 the ENIAC contained 1,800 square feet and consisted of almost 20,000 vacuum tubes, 1500 relays, 10000 capacitoors, and 70000 resistors. 
    The ENIAC calculated a trajectory in 30 seconds that took a human 20 hours, the ENIAC project cost about 500000.

<h3>The Background Of John Mauchly (Founder Of ENIAC)</h3>

<p>John Mauchly was born in 1907 and died in 1980, He was the visionary and co-inventer of the first real purpose computars. 
    John Mauchly was born in cincinnati, ohio, he was the of sebastian jacob and rachel elizebeth mauchly. 
    His father was a respected physisct who taught on high school and college levels, He did research in elecrticity and earth currents. 
    John Mauchly was mainly focused oon science and engineering and study these subjects at John Hopkins University's School of Engineering. 
    After growing bored of the subject, He transferred to the physics department.

<h2 id="IBM">IBM's Personal Computer</h2>

<p>
    on August 12, 1981, the IBM Personal computer would be introduced to the public as one of the most key milestones (in my opinion) in the development of a computer, logical device or software. 
    A group of containing 12 strategists were picked, working around the clock to come up with a plan for hardware, software, manufacturing setup and how to sale the product. 
    The development team went outside of the traditional boundaries of product development within IMB, the team would go to outside vendors to buy their parts such as a CPU and other products needed to compose the IBM personal computer, doing this, they were able to release the product in 12 months. 
    After the IBM Personal Computer, it became the leading platform in a revolution that would bring other companies to make their own copy of the computer but better and better over the next few years bring us to the present.
    The IBM Personal computer almost didn't become a reality, poeple were very spectacle of the idea asking questions like "why would someone want to bring a computer inside their home?".
    In the 1970s, if you happem to have some left over work you were to bring back home a breifcase full papers, oonce you were home, you would either have a pincle to finish up or a type writer.
    Their weren't any technology that could help yoou at home to finihs up your work, if you didn't have any knowledge of a word you'll have to use a deictionary for assistants, while on the other hand in the present you were just able to pull out yoour laptop or phone and look up a word that yoou couldn't understand of spell.

id="Apple">
    Apple's Macintosh
</h2>

<p>
    The Macintosh was the first widely sold personal computer with a GUI and a mouse. Apple is widely known for releasing next gen devises, apple (in my opinion) is mostly known for their camera quality on phones and laptops. Apple was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. The Macintosh was one of the biggest products known from apple back in the day being released in 1985 while also introducing the modern graphical user interface. After the release, apple struggled after its board ousted Steve Jobs in 1985. When Steve Jobs returned to apple in 1997, it almost fell to bankruptcy. Steve Jobs saved the company by introducing many different devices that would save the company from bankruptcy. After releasing many devices, apple gained almost 40 billion in profits in its fiscal year. The Macintosh is a good example on how one thing can bring many things into realty such as the newest iPhone r the newest MacBook air.

<h2 id="windows">The Launch of Windows</h2>

</h2>

<p>
    The two people Bill Gates and Paul Allen started Microsoft, both, in 1980, struck a deal to provide the operating system for IBM Personal Computer.  
    Five years later, in 1985, Microsoft released Windows in 1985. 
    Microsoft was originally called micro-soft, in order to pursue his dream, Allen quit his job as a programmer and Bill Gates left Harvard to focus on their new company "micro-soft". 
    Microsoft gained over 1 million in cash and in 1979 Microsoft's headquarters moved to Bellevue, Washington, a suburb of Seattle. 
    In 1985, the released Windows and later became the most famous tech company being names Microsoft.

<h2 id="worldweb">World Wide Web</h2>

<p>
    The World Wide web keeps all of us connected from great distances.
    The World Wide Web helps us do what we can do now in the present.
    The World Wide Web 1989, as this makes a big part of the internet going from the ENIAC to the Macintosh.
    On 30 April 1993, CERN put the World Wide Web software in the public domain.
    From that point everything is history from the past to the near future.
