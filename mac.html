    Apple's Macintosh
</h2>

<p>
    <i>The Macintosh</i> was the first widely sold personal computer with a GUI and a mouse. Apple is widely known for releasing next gen devises, apple (in my opinion) is mostly known for their camera quality on phones and laptops. Apple was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. The <i>Macintosh</i> was one of the biggest products known from apple back in the day being released in 1985 while also introducing the modern graphical user interface. After the release, apple struggled after its board ousted Steve Jobs in 1985. When Steve Jobs returned to apple in 1997, it almost fell to bankruptcy. Steve Jobs saved the company by introducing many different devices that would save the company from bankruptcy. After releasing many devices, apple gained almost 40 billion in profits in its fiscal year. The <i>Macintosh</i> is a good example on how one thing can bring many things into realty such as the newest iPhone or the newest MacBook air.
